# Moidvk Parameter Passing Regression

## Issue
The moidvk tools parameter passing bug has regressed. The fix documented in `MOIDVK_JS_TOOLS_DESTRUCTURING_ERROR.md` was reverted.

## Status
- **Date Found**: 2025-01-23
- **Severity**: High - All moidvk tools affected
- **Resolution**: Fixed but requires server restart

## Root Cause
In server.js line 327, the code had reverted to:
```javascript
const result = await handler(args || {});
```

## Fix Applied
Changed line 327 back to:
```javascript
const result = await handler({ params: args || {} });
```

## Next Steps
1. Restart the moidvk MCP server to load the fix
2. Test moidvk tools to confirm they work
3. Consider adding automated tests to prevent regression

## Tool Testing Results
### Working Tools ✅
- KB-MCP tools (kb_list, kb_read, etc.)
- Standard Claude Code tools (Bash, Grep, LS, WebSearch)
- Sequential thinking MCP
- IDE integration tools

### Currently Affected ❌
- All moidvk tools due to parameter passing issue (fix applied, restart needed)

## Recommendation
The moidvk server needs to be restarted for the parameter fix to take effect.
