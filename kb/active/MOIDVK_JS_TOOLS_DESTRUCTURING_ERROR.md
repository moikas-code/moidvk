# Moidvk JavaScript Tools Destructuring Error - RESOLVED

## Issue Description
Multiple moidvk JavaScript analysis tools were failing with "Right side of assignment cannot be destructured" errors:

- `moidvk_js_test_analyzer`
- `moidvk_bundle_size_analyzer` 
- `moidvk_js_performance_analyzer`

## Error Pattern
```
❌ Analysis failed: Right side of assignment cannot be destructured
```

## Root Cause Analysis
**RESOLVED**: The issue was NOT with JavaScript parsing or destructuring syntax. The problem was in the **MCP server integration layer**.

### Investigation Results
1. **Parser Dependencies**: @babel/parser v7.28.0 - up to date and working correctly
2. **Tool Functions**: All individual tool handlers work perfectly when called directly
3. **JavaScript Parsing**: All destructuring patterns parse correctly with Babel
4. **MCP Integration**: **BUG FOUND** - Server was passing arguments incorrectly

### The Actual Bug
In `server.js` line 327, the MCP server was calling:
```javascript
const result = await handler(args || {});
```

But the handlers expect:
```javascript
const result = await handler({ params: args || {} });
```

## Solution Implemented
**Fixed in server.js line 327:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken)
const result = await handler(args || {});

// AFTER (fixed)
const result = await handler({ params: args || {} });
```

## Verification
✅ All tools now work correctly when called through MCP server
✅ Direct function calls work perfectly
✅ All destructuring patterns parse correctly
✅ Bundle analysis works (with expected bun build warnings)

## Status
- **Severity**: High - Multiple core JS tools affected
- **Impact**: JavaScript/TypeScript analysis capabilities restored
- **Resolution**: Complete - MCP server parameter passing fixed
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-01-23

## Lessons Learned
1. Always test MCP integration layer separately from tool logic
2. Parameter passing between MCP client/server needs careful validation
3. Error messages can be misleading - "destructuring" error was actually parameter structure issue
4. Multiple running server instances can mask fixes - always restart servers after changes

## Files Modified
- `server.js` - Fixed MCP handler parameter passing
- `test/debug-destructuring-issue.js` - Created comprehensive test cases
- `test/test-mcp-fix.js` - Created MCP integration test
