# Secure Bash Process Initialization Issue

## Problem
The moidvk secure_bash tool fails with "Cannot access 'process' before initialization" error when trying to run cargo commands.

## Root Cause
- Node.js module caching in MCP server is loading old version of EnhancedSecureCommandExecutor
- Process reference fixes were applied but cached modules prevent them from taking effect
- Multiple MCP server processes running with stale cached modules

## Evidence
- Regular Bash tool works perfectly with cargo commands
- All Rust compilation issues are resolved (cargo check succeeds)
- Error persists despite fixes to process references in security files

## Files Fixed
- `/lib/security/EnhancedSecureCommandExecutor.js` - Added `const nodeProcess = process;`
- `/lib/security/secure-grep.js` - Fixed process reference
- `/lib/filesystem/embedding-manager.js` - Fixed process.cwd() calls
- `/lib/filesystem/security-validator.js` - Fixed process.cwd() calls

## Current Status
- ✅ Rust code compiles successfully
- ✅ Regular bash tools work with cargo
- ❌ MCP secure bash requires server restart to clear cache
- ❌ Complex commands (cd && cargo) may need different approach

## Solution Required
**Restart MCP server processes** to clear Node.js module cache and load fixed security code.

## Workaround
Use regular Bash tool for cargo commands until secure bash cache is cleared.

## Related Commands That Work
```bash
# These work with regular Bash tool:
cargo check
cargo build
cargo test
```
